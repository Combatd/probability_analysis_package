# Probability Analysis Package

 Content for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree curriculum (Term 2), which includes project and lesson content. Using Object-Oriented Programming, we will build a Python package for analyzing probability distributions.

## Lesson Outline
* Object-oriented programming syntax

   * procedural vs object-oriented programming
   * classes, objects, methods and attributes
   * coding a class
   * magic methods
   * inheritance

* Using object-oriented programming to make a Python package

   * making a package
   * tour of scikit-learn source code
   * putting your package on PyPi

## Objects are defined by characteristics and actions

Another way to think about characteristics and actions is in terms of English grammar. A characteristic would be a noun. On the other hand, an action would be a verb.

Let's pick something from the real-world: a dog. A few characteristics could be the dog's weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. What actions would a dog take? A dog can bark, run, bite and eat. These are all verbs.
