# Probability Analysis Package

 Content for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree curriculum (Term 2), which includes project and lesson content. Using Object-Oriented Programming, we will build a Python package for analyzing probability distributions.

## Lesson Outline
* Object-oriented programming syntax

   * procedural vs object-oriented programming
   * classes, objects, methods and attributes
   * coding a class
   * magic methods
   * inheritance

* Using object-oriented programming to make a Python package

   * making a package
   * tour of scikit-learn source code
   * putting your package on PyPi

## Objects are defined by characteristics and actions

Another way to think about characteristics and actions is in terms of English grammar. A characteristic would be a noun. On the other hand, an action would be a verb.

Let's pick something from the real-world: a dog. A few characteristics could be the dog's weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. What actions would a dog take? A dog can bark, run, bite and eat. These are all verbs.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Vocabulary

* class - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes
* object - an instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a yellow pencil, a small dog, a blue shirt, etc. However, as you'll see later in the lesson, objects can be more abstract.
* attribute - a descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.
* method - an action that a class or object could take
* OOP - a commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming
* encapsulation - one of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.
